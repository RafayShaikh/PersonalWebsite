								<h2>Welcome!</a></h2>
								<p>Here you can find about my professional and personal interests</p>

								<strong>Hello!</strong> I am a Software Developer currently finishing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, Texas.
								One of my biggest endaveours is to make people lives easier and efficient using technologies available or by creating new techonolgies. My main focus is to use new 
								technologies inconjunction with the already available beautiful nature. I beleive when the nature meets new techonolgies, the world leaps forward. I beleive in the diversity
								of ideas coming from all parts of the world because it joins the unique thinking of different backgrounds to make something that works efficiently. <strong>I am a dependable,
								accessible, honest, result-oriented, open-minded, and punctual person.</strong>
							</p>
							<h2>My Background</a></h2>
							<p>
								My birthplace is Karachi, Pakistan. Karachi is the biggest city of Pakistan with a population of 16 million people which makes it 
								double the population of New York according the last census. My hometown shaped me into a very social and understanding person 
								because these are the only way to make it successfully out of that city. Growing up I learned that teamwork is very important in 
								this city because there is no other way around. There were more than a hundred students per class one instructor. If I want to 
								learn, I must talk and collaborate in the class. Living in this city also allow me to understand the importance of the time because 
								if I am the first one to achive something, I'll nowhere to be found.This is also because of lack of resources was very evident in this
								overly populated city because of low budget to take care of all these people. The city also taught me to prioritize my tasks depending
								on my needs. All together I have quite an experience growing up in that city and migrating to the United States of America.
							</p>
							<p>
								I always loved America because of my uncle who came here before my birth. I always had a connection with USA, so adjusting to the norms 
								of the society here did'nt took a while. That being said learning new things about the society here made me eager to learn more. My college
								life prepared me for my professional career very well because I focused on every prespective of Computer Science. This also helped me to secure
								good grades thourout my college life while making good friends in the field. I am planning to continue my education after getting my dream job
								because I beleive that learning is the part of life. Also, <strong>Learning new things give us ability to overcome the difficuties.</strong>
