							<h3><a>Future Learning</a></h3>

							<p> Development of smart phones was the main reason to join the computer science because of the ability
							to make great apps and using the power of the hardware efficiently. Artificial intelligence became an interesting topic as time 
							progressed. Creation of unnamed aircrafts and autonomous cars made me pursue this career more than ever. Using artificial
							intelligence to reduce the load on the consumer and pushing machines to extremes was the turning point of this industry.
							I see myself in this industry to help improve the communities’ living standards by reducing the workload so they can come
							up with creative ideas. Selling products online, getting services online, or purchasing a car online made consumers’ lives
							easy, so they can spend their time with their loved ones. Before these developments in the field,
							we used to travel miles and spend days in the queues to purchase something. Now we can enjoy the same product in the matter
							of hours on our doorsteps. These developments in COSC inspire me to learn subjects like advance artificial intelligence, mobile programming,
							internet programming, operating systems, data science, and machine learning in depth.
