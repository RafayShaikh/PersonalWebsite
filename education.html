							<h3><a>Thoughts on Education</a></h3>

							<p>
								In my eyes, education is very important because it helps a person to distinguish between reality and fiction.
								It helps to see the world in a educated perspective, to see and accept people’s ideologies, to make calculated 
								life decisions, and to make the world a better place for others. My educational goals include all the above with a few more. 
								It also includes to learn deeply about computing world. Moreover, learning about artificial intelligence, machine learning,
								data science, automation, and autonomous vehicles will be my prime focus in my educational career and in professional career.
								Learning these will be very important for me because I want to pursue a career in computer science
								focusing on automation using A.I. Completing my computer science bachelor’s degree is the first step toward succeeding my 
								educational goal. I will be continuing education when I will begin my master’s program after a few years of work experience.
								I will be able to complete my goals if I remained focus and dedicated like I am right now.
